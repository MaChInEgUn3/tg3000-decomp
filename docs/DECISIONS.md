# Decisions & confirmed facts

Single source of truth for project scope and state. Update it whenever a decision
changes or a fact is confirmed, so any person or agent session can resume without
re-deriving anything. Dates are absolute.

## Scope (2026-11-13)

- **This repository = reference disassembly + readable C of the game logic.**
  Platform ports (Linux x86-64, Windows x86-64, maybe Mega Drive/Genesis one day)
  live in a **separate repository** that consumes the C from here.
- **Readable C from the start.** No static recompiler and no "ugly generated C"
  phase. Offered and rejected.
- **The disassembly is a reference listing**, not a deliverable that must
  reassemble to the ROM. Byte-matching the C is impossible anyway (the original is
  hand-written 65816); fidelity is proven by differential testing instead.
- **"Not even 1% emulator" in the shipped game.** No CPU/PPU/SPC700/DSP-4 model in
  any port. DSP-4 commands become native game functions; video and the sound driver
  are rewritten natively in the port repository.
- **The bench (`tools/bench/`) is allowed to emulate.** It runs the original ROM to
  produce the ground truth the C is compared against. It is a measuring instrument,
  never linked into the game, never shipped.

## Portability rules for the C (because of a possible 68000 port)

- Fixed-width types only (`uint8_t`, `int16_t`, ...).
- ROM data read byte by byte with explicit little-endian helpers; never cast a
  pointer into ROM/RAM to a wider type.
- No floating point; keep the original fixed-point math.
- Game state lives at the original WRAM offsets, so the bench can diff it. Access
  16-bit values through explicit lo/hi helpers, never by aliasing two bytes.
- Video, sound and DSP-4 sit behind interfaces. **Do not design `video_*`/`sound_*`
  yet**: the boundary is wherever the code/data map shows the game building its
  RAM buffers and uploading them.

## Verification

- Per-routine differential test (primary): when the bench's interpreter reaches the
  entry of a ported routine, it snapshots state, runs the C on a copy, lets the
  original run to its return, then diffs WRAM, returned registers/flags and the
  MMIO/DSP-4 writes. This allows porting leaves first, each with pass/fail.
- Per-frame WRAM hash (secondary), once whole frame paths are ported.
- Video/sound are rewritten, so they are checked by eye/ear or tolerant screenshot
  comparison, not by lockstep.

## Bench core (2026-11-13)

- **`dinkc64/LakeSnes`** (fork of `angelo-wf/LakeSnes`, which is archived), commit
  `048a0d7` (2025-04-11). MIT, plain C, SPC700 + S-DSP included, already has a
  coprocessor mapper hook in `snes/cart.c` (the CX4, cart type 4) to copy for the
  DSP-4. The 12 `snes/*.c` files compile headless with `gcc -O2 -Wall`, no SDL
  needed. Fetched into `ext/` (ignored), not vendored yet.
- Rejected: snes9x (non-free licence), bsnes/Mesen2 (GPL, large, and their DSP-4
  is low-level emulation needing the chip firmware, which we don't have).
- The SPC700 is only proven to work once the ROM gets past the sound-driver
  handshake (bench-3).

## Bench boot check (bench-3, 2026-11-13)

- Headless boot works: Kemco/Gremlin title (~frame 120), the full intro story
  ("Once every millennium...", frames ~400-2900), then the main menu
  (Championship / VS Mode) at ~frame 3000. The SPC700 handshake therefore passes,
  and the picture renders correctly (`--dump DIR --every N`, 256x224 PNG).
- Start does not skip the intro. In the menu, Start/A/B taps lead to a
  Difficulty / Music / Exit screen; no race reached by blind tapping, so **still zero
  DSP-4 writes after 9,000 frames**. Expected: the chip is for the road. Reaching a
  race is left to bench-5 (the owner plays and records a movie).
- Movie format: `tools/bench/movies/*.txt`, one `<frame> <buttons>` per line, keyed
  by the bench's loop index (not `snes->frames`, which skipped one value around
  frame 2,900 in a run; check this in bench-4).

## Legal posture

Never committed: the ROM (`*.sfc`), DSP firmware, extracted assets, third-party
code fetched at build time (e.g. snes-dsp4). The build asks for the user's own ROM
and checks its hash.

## Publishing (requested 2026-11-13)

The owner wants a **public** GitHub repository, polished, accepting PRs
(account `MaChInEgUn3`, `gh` already logged in). The owner delegated the details to
the advisor, who settled them on 2026-11-13:

- **Name:** `MaChInEgUn3/tg3000-decomp`.
- **Commits:** local commits start now, one per finished loop unit. Author identity
  is the GitHub noreply address (`28672726+MaChInEgUn3@users.noreply.github.com`),
  never the owner's real email.
- **Publishing gate:** bench-3 and bench-4 pass, and a fresh clone builds with
  `fetch.sh` + `make`. Then create the repo **private**, push, list the remote tree
  to confirm no ROM / `ext/` / `build/` / frame dumps, and only then make it public.
- **Repo contents for launch:** README in English + `README.pt-br.md`, CONTRIBUTING,
  PR and issue templates, CI that runs `fetch.sh` + `make` without the ROM,
  a generated progress block (as in `memories-decomp`), `CREDITS.md`.
- Never pushed: ROM, `ext/`, firmware, `build/`, frame dumps (game assets).
  `CLAUDE.md` is local, not versioned.

## Licence (decided 2026-11-13)

**GPL-3.0-or-later**, chosen by the owner. This allows using
`StackBlender/snes-dsp4` (GPL-3.0-or-later) both in the bench and as a source for the
native DSP-4 C, with credit. The LICENSE file goes in with the GitHub setup.

## DSP-4 on the bench (2026-11-13)

- The game talks to the chip at **`$30:8000`/`$30:8001`** (data register, word = low
  byte then high byte): 560 static long `LDA`/`STA` to `$30:8000` in the ROM. No
  static access to the status half (`$C000-$FFFF`) was found; the mapper still
  routes it (banks `$30-$3F`/`$B0-$BF`, `$8000-$BFFF` data, `$C000-$FFFF` status).
- Boot handshake at `$80:8080` (frame 50): `PEA $3030; PLB; PLB`, then read the data
  register until it has returned `$FFFF` 256 times in a row, then `JSR $89DB`, then
  `BRA *` (idle loop; the game runs from NMI). The bench passes it.
- LakeSnes patch: `tools/bench/patches/lakesnes-dsp4.patch` (cart type 5, selected by
  the header: LoROM + coprocessor 0 + title `TOP GEAR 3000`). `tools/bench/fetch.sh`
  re-creates `ext/` at pinned commits and applies it.
- Known nit: LakeSnes allocates 1 KB cart RAM from the header even though the header
  says no SRAM; harmless unless the game touches banks `$70-$7D`.

## Target ROM

- `TG3000.sfc` — Top Gear 3000 (USA), 1,048,576 bytes, no copier header.
- Header: title `TOP GEAR 3000`, map `$30` (LoROM, FastROM), type `$03`
  (ROM + DSP), region `$01` (USA), version 0, checksum `$5327` / complement `$ACD8`;
  computed checksum matches.
- CRC32 `a20be998`, MD5 `23eaa07e3f3315fa43f4b4d94ec97a7b`,
  SHA-1 `058aadf1ee719cb9e0c7333e665797f990a6381d`.
- No-Intro hash not yet cross-checked (DAT-o-MATIC).

- `StackBlender/snes-dsp4` — clean-room DSP-4 (GPL), 96–100% exact on recordings.
